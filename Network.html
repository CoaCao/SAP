                                                fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that allows access to confidential
                                                files stored in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Because the files
                                                contain sensitive information, the company does not want any files
                                                to traverse the public Internet. Bucket access should be restricted
                                                to only allow the web portal’s EC2 instances. To comply with the
                                                requirements, the Solutions Architect created an Amazon S3 VPC
                                                endpoint and associated it with the web portal’s VPC.<br><br>Which
