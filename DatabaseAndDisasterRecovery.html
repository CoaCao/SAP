                                                backend servers are hosted on the company’s on-premises data center. The

                                                depending on the user state. Access to the backend services is

                                                platform that is hosted on its on-premises data center. The webservers
                                                connect to a MySQL database. The e-commerce platform is quickly gaining
                                                popularity and the management is worried that the on-premises servers
                                                won’t be able to keep up with user traffic in the coming months. They
                                                decided to migrate the entire application to AWS to take advantage of
                                                the scalability of the cloud. The following are required for this

                                                Increase the reliability and availability of the application.<br><br>-
                                                Reduce the latency between the users and the application.<br><br>-

                                            <i>Amazon Aurora is a modern relational database service offering
                                                performance and high availability at scale, fully open-source MySQL and
                                                PostgreSQL-compatible editions. Unlike other databases, after a database
                                                crash, Amazon Aurora does not need to replay the redo log from the last
                                                database checkpoint (typically five minutes) and confirm that all
                                                changes have been applied before making the database available for
                                                operations. Amazon Aurora moves the buffer cache out of the database
                                                process and makes it available immediately at restart time. This
                                                prevents you from having to throttle access until the cache is
                                                repopulated to avoid brownouts. This reduces database restart times to
                                                less than 60 seconds in most cases.</i>

                                                database hosted in Amazon RDS, and a central data warehouse that runs on
                                                Amazon Redshift. There is a batch analytics process that runs every day
                                                that reads data from RDS. During the execution of the batch analytics,
                                                the RDS utilization spikes up, which results in the CRM application
                                                being unresponsive. The top management dashboard must also be updated
                                                with new data right after the batch analytics processing completes.
                                                However, the dashboard is on another system running on-premises and
                                                cannot be modified directly. The only way to update the dashboard is to
                                                send an email with the new data to the dashboard system via SMTP, which
                                                will then be parsed and processed to update the dashboard with the
